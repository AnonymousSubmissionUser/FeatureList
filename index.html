<center> <h2> Features </h2>
<p> <b> Notes: </b> </p>
<p> All features are based around the <i> principal range of motion </i> which is between 10% of the range of motion to 
  90% of the range of motion </p>
<p> All features are extracted from both extension and flexion motions </p> 
<p> The features in both diagrams are identical but have separate ids as they pertain to two separate fingers </p></center>
